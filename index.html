<b>How the World Wide Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. When you open a browser and go to a web page like www.google.com or www.yahoo.com, your  computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> across the internet to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the your computer where your <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

  for addition explaination.

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents are the main type on the web. 
HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.

<b>Tags and Elements and Attributes</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>, <b>Tags</b>, and <b>Attributes</b>.  <b>Elements</b> represents a structure 
and has a start tag, content, and end tag.  <b>Tags</b> are used at the beginning and end of HTML.  <b>Attributes</b> 
are used to define a property.

  explains the distinction well.

<b>Technological Empathy</b>
<p>Computers interpret instructions literally.  They cannot intrupt the intent of the programmer.  This can cause huge problems
in the program and make a small mistake a huge problem.  
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements applies only to the content inside of them.  While Inline applies to the entire section of code. <b>Example</b> Break is inline while Paragraph is block.
